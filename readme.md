Veralux-Suite is the culmination of ready made depoloyable systems. It is the poof of concept of an Intelligent AI system builder that goes beyond simple prompt based building. This resource allows the dev to  truly unlock effecient scalability by keeping things modular and globally injected.
For example the branding of this project is defined by the user and will be passed along to the model that is generated using this software along with characteristics like modular tools designed for the Vera or Solomon systems.

This design was intitially a monolithic structure but was refined to ensure easy debugging and troubleshooting. That being said it is easyily modified to suite any system and is able to deploy through render, and railway just to start. After completing this proof of concept automated deployments seemed extremely useful however not ideal for the best use of AI technology as an asset and I wanted to pursue truly helpful solutions not the typical snatch and grab.
