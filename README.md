## ðŸ“¦ Repo Structure

```
/admin/                       â†’ Admin portal for company settings
/solomon-template/           â†’ Base Solomon template with dynamic placeholders
/provisioned/                â†’ Auto-generated client-specific Solomon builds (ignored)
/provision-client.js         â†’ Script to generate new client deployments
/solomon-template-variables.json â†’ All dynamic fields supported in provisioning
```

## ðŸš€ Provision a New Solomon Client

Use this command to generate a ready-to-push Solomon instance for a new client:

```bash
node provision-client.js \
  --name brightbuild \
  --color "#1A73E8" \
  --accent "#174EA6" \
  --drive 1AbCdEfGhXYZ
```

This will:
- Clone the template
- Replace placeholders with client info
- Create a folder at `/provisioned/solomon-brightbuild/`

You then:
1. `cd provisioned/solomon-brightbuild`
2. `git init && git remote add origin git@github.com:VeraLux-AI/solomon-brightbuild.git`
3. `git push -u origin main`
4. Deploy to Render

## ðŸ›  Template Fields

See [`solomon-template-variables.json`](./solomon-template-variables.json) for a full list of fields.

You can build a UI or automate this flow using that file as your contract.

Veralux-Suite is the culmination of ready made depoloyable systems. It is the poof of concept of an Intelligent AI system builder that goes beyond simple prompt based building. This resource allows the dev to truly unlock effecient scalability by keeping things modular and globally injected. For example the branding of this project is defined by the user and will be passed along to the model that is generated using this software along with characteristics like modular tools designed for the Vera or Solomon systems.

This design was intitially a monolithic structure but was refined to ensure easy debugging and troubleshooting. That being said it is easyily modified to suite any system and is able to deploy through render, and railway just to start. After completing this proof of concept automated deployments seemed extremely useful however not ideal for the best use of AI technology as an asset and I wanted to pursue truly helpful solutions not the typical snatch and grab.
